Do you want to validate get next line??
Its easy...
Just understand how your code works my friend.

Return 1 - if reading has completed.
Return -1 - if there was an error
or Return 0 - if reading has completed.

Memcheck tries to establish what the illegal address might relate to, since that's often useful. So, if it points into a block of memory which has already been freed, you'll be informed of this, and also where the block was freed. Likewise, if it should turn out to be just off the end of a heap block, a common result of off-by-one-errors in array subscripting, you'll be informed of this fact, and also where the block was allocated.

Thank you.
